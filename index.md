# Supriya Pan

**Postdoctoral Researcher in Neutrino Physics**

I am a postdoctoral researcher working on neutrino oscillations, Lorentz invariance violation, and physics beyond the Standard Model. My research combines theoretical modeling with phenomenological studies relevant for current and future neutrino experiments.

## Research Interests

- Neutrino oscillations and matter effects  
- Lorentz invariance violation (LIV)  
- Beyond the Standard Model neutrino physics  
- Reactor and solar neutrino phenomenology  

## Current Position

Postdoctoral Researcher  
Department of Physics  
Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile
